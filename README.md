# Dungeon Adventurer 
Dungeon Adventurer was a game I made for a 48 hour game jam in my city. This project was done by myself and was largely used as an attempt for me to learn the Godot game engine. I also exclusively used C# for my scripting language. 
## Completed Features
- Basic weapon and item pickup system (utilized custom signals)
- Basic UI for health, stamina, mana, and gold (utilized Godot's UI nodes and custom signals)
- Player movement and enemy movement.
- Basic level system (the .exe in this repo only contains one finished level, however)
- Projectiles for the player to dodge.
## Features I Would Have Liked to Implement
- Implement player and enemy spellcasting.
- Implement a more robust inventory system that includes potions and such.
- More sophisticated enemy AI.
